Laboratory proyect to playing around with playwright

At the [Dot Net Conf 2022](https://dotnet2022.com/) I had assited at an interesting talk about
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/) from [Debbie O'Brien](https://twitter.com/debs_obrien)

Playwriht seem to be an excelent tool for end to end testing, worth to try it. There were several interesting points:
* Open source project
* Microsoft is behind the project
* It is cross language (typescript, .net, java, phyton)
* It could be integrated in CI/CD pipelines
